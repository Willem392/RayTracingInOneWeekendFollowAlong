# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

Welcome to my repository for following along with Peter Shirley's book, "Ray Tracing in One Weekend." This repository contains my implementations and exercises based on the book's content, which serves as an introduction to the fundamentals of ray tracing.

## Project Overview

"Ray Tracing in One Weekend" is a concise guide to building a basic ray tracer from scratch. The book covers the core principles of ray tracing, including:

- **Ray-Sphere Intersection**: Implementing the mathematical algorithms to determine if and where a ray intersects a sphere.
- **Lighting and Shading**: Adding basic lighting and shading to render scenes with simple materials.
- **Scene Composition**: Building scenes with multiple objects and rendering them to an image file.
- **Materials and Textures**: Applying different materials and textures to objects to simulate realistic appearance.

### Whatâ€™s Included

This repository will contain code that implements the concepts and exercises presented in the book. It showcases how to:

- Define and manipulate 3D vectors and rays.
- Perform ray-object intersection tests.
- Implement basic camera functionality for rendering scenes.
- Apply simple materials and shading techniques.
- Generate and save rendered images to a file.

### Acknowledgments

A special thanks to Peter Shirley for his insightful book on ray tracing. It provides a clear and practical introduction to the subject, which has been invaluable for learning and experimentation.

Feel free to explore the code and see how the ray tracer evolves with each chapter of the book. Happy ray tracing!
